# Final_Comp_project_F18

This is a modular function, with different parts of the job carried out by a different function. 

There is a main function (blurMain), a blurring function (blurImage / imageBlur), a loop that feeds the relevant part of the matrix to the blurring function (blurCallLoop), and a GUI function (blurGUI), a function that adds a border of zeroes to the matrix for the function to work(addBorderFunction).

The functions were made by:

blurMain: Shrey
blurImage: Mazen (imageBlur rn)
blurCallLoop: Shrey
blurGUI: Shrey, 
addBorderFunction: Shrey
